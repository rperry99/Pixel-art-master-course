- **Challenge 1** | This challenge, I was just supposed to play with lines, to get used to them.
- **Challenge 2** | I had to get used to drawing shapes. Drawing circles, squares, etc. I also needed to create some type of object near me, so I made a rubber duck and a Nintendo Switch.
- **Challenge 3** | I needed to shade each of these items, with gradually more detail, from a different light angle than what the video taught.
